# backbone-model

  Backbone models as a discrete component, with sync stripped out. 

  This has been run against the official Backbone test suite and passes all tests.

## Installation

  Install with [npm(1)](http://npmjs.org):

    $ npm install --save backbone-model

  Install with [component(1)](http://component.io):

    $ component install green-mesa/backbone-model

## API

### Normal usage

```javascript

  var Model = require('backbone-model').Model;

  var MyModel = Model.extend({ someShizzle : "Hello world"});

  var myInstanceOfMyModel = new MyModel();
```

### Adding Backbone Sync functionality.

You need to `$ component install green-mesa/backbone-sync` (which, by the way, will also install jQuery. Fun times. A non-jQuery replacement would be good at this point)

```javascript

	var Model = require('backbone-model').Model;
	var sync = require('backbone-sync').sync;
	
	Model.prototype.sync = function(){

		return sync.apply(this, arguments);

	};
```

Some commonJS related quirks mean that overridding the ajax handler is a bit pointless as you've already got jQuery installed by default. Write a replacement `backbone-sync` module and use that instead. That's the component way.
